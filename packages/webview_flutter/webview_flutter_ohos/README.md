# webview\_flutter\_ohos

The OpenHarmony implementation of [`webview_flutter`][1].

## Usage

This package is [endorsed][2], which means you can simply use `webview_flutter`
normally. This package will be automatically included in your app when you do,
so you do not need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml`.

However, if you `import` this package to use any of its APIs directly, you
should add it to your `pubspec.yaml` as usual.

## Display Mode

This plugin supports two different platform view display modes. The default display mode is subject
to change in the future, and will not be considered a breaking change, so if you want to ensure a
specific mode, you can set it explicitly.
